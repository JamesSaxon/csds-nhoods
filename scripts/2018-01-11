liveramp - SDK with the location of the phone
aggregated by liveramp, which is mostly television ads and such, gave it to CARTO and they let Jamie use it 
app field - type of app (e.g. navigation), but that means users can show up on multiple apps at the same point at the same time; got to think about the frequency of the data points
precision: if it’s zero, this has been concentrated in a few apps; they don’t have access to the real location so they figure it out some other way (e.g. from IP address in Chicago)
- Jamie gets rid of all of those weird imprecise points; group at MIT… somebody Mauro, checking how long you stay in a single location

-> NEEDS TO BE ORDERED
-> HAS THE LAT LONG BUT 

How are places actually interrelated and how does that matter for people: integration with neighbors and/or with the city

Also social control questions: for example for crime (we’re seeing whether people do or don’t go out). There’s crime, I’m scared <=> I don’t go out, there’s crime
Doesn’t predict social cohesion questions at all even though controlling for stuff. 
 
CODE ALL THE HIGHWAYS: ism, download all the data, but it’s a granularity issue (exclude major highways but maybe not smaller roads)
